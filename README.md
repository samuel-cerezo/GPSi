# GNSS-inertial state initialization by distance residuals

This repository contains a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix singular values.

## 🚀 Features

- Closed-form initialization based on GNSS and IMU only.
- Observability-based strategy to determine when to trigger GPS alignment.
- Accurate estimation of:
  - IMU velocity and gravity
  - Accelerometer and gyroscope biases
  - Extrinsic transformation \( T_{WB} \) from body to world
- Tested on **EuRoC** and **GVINS** datasets.

## 🧠 Motivation

In GNSS-denied or degraded environments, it's critical to initialize a tightly coupled navigation system using the minimal set of sensors available. GPSi aims to provide a fast and reliable state estimate without relying on visual features, enabling safe operation and global localization even before visual odometry is available or reliable.
